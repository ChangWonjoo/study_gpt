This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIREDOn Friday, a lone Microsoft developer rocked the world when he revealed a backdoor had been intentionally planted in XZ Utils, an open source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.\"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library,\" software and cryptography engineer Filippo Valsorda said of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so far.What Is XZ Utils?XZ Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression on virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. XZ Utils provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all kinds of operations. XZ Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making this component even more crucial.What Happened?Andres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL offerings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system was experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging in to devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too many CPU cycles and were generating errors with valgrind, a utility for monitoring computer memory.Through sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the problems were the result of updates that had been made to XZ Utils. On Friday, Freund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression software.It's hard to overstate the complexity of the social engineering and the inner workings of the backdoor. Thomas Roccia, a researcher at Microsoft, published a graphic on Mastodon that helps visualize the sprawling extent of the nearly successful endeavor to spread a backdoor with a reach that would have dwarfed the SolarWinds event from 2020.What Does the Backdoor Do?Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it's not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys or installing malware.Wait, How Can a Compression Utility Manipulate a Process as Security-Sensitive as SSH?Any library can tamper with the inner workings of any executable it is linked against. Often, the developer of the executable will establish a link to a library that's needed for it to work properly. OpenSSH, the most popular sshd implementation, doesn’t link the liblzma library, but Debian and many other Linux distributions add a patch to link sshd to systemd, a program that loads a variety of services during the system bootup. Systemd, in turn, links to liblzma, and this allows XZ Utils to exert control over sshd.How Did This Backdoor Come to Be?It would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone with the username JiaT75 made their first known commit to an open source project. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious, because it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that has long been recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.Ars TechnicaThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.The following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the XZ Utils mailing list, and, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of XZ Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to maintain the project.In January 2023, JiaT75 made their first commit to XZ Utils. In the months following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in XZ Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins’ contact information with their own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open source software for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz disable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from detecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to XZ Utils.In February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or others appealed to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the updates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into several releases, according to security firm Tenable. There’s more about Tan and the timeline here.Can You Say More About What This Backdoor Does?In a nutshell, it allows someone with the right private key to hijack sshd, the executable file responsible for making SSH connections, and from there to execute malicious commands. The backdoor is implemented through a five-stage loader that uses a series of simple but clever techniques to hide itself. It also provides the means for new payloads to be delivered without major changes being required.Multiple people who have reverse-engineered the updates have much more to say about the backdoor. Developer Sam James provided an overview here.In an online interview, developer and reverse engineer HD Moore confirmed the Sam James suspicion that the backdoor targeted either Debian or Red Hat distributions.“The attack was sneaky in that it only did the final steps of the backdoor if you were building the library on amd64 (intel x86 64-bit) and were building a Debian or a RPM package (instead of using it for a local installation),” he wrote.Paraphrasing observations from researchers who collectively spent the weekend analyzing the malicious updates, he continued:When verifying an SSH public key, if the public key matches a certain fingerprint function, the key contents are decrypted using a pre-shared key before the public key is actually verified. The decrypted contents are then passed directly to system.If the fingerprint doesn't match or the decrypted contents don't match a certain format, it falls back to regular key verification and no-one's the wiser.The backdoor is super sneaky. It uses a little-known feature of the glibc to hook a function. It only triggers when the backdoored xz library gets loaded by a /usr/bin/sshd process on one of the affected distributions. There may be many other backdoors, but the one everyone is talking about uses the function indirection stuff to add the hook. The payload was encoded into fake xz test files and runs as a shellcode effectively, changing the SSH RSA key verification code so that a magic public key (sent during normal authentication) let the attacker gain access​​Their grand scheme was:sneakily backdoor the release tarballs, but not the source codeuse sockpuppet accounts to convince the various Linux distributions to pull the latest version and package itonce those distributions shipped it, they could take over any downstream user/company system/etcResearchers from networking firm Akamai also explain well how the backdoor works here.What More Do We Know About Jia Tan?At the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a piece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as XZ Utils. This developer persona has touched dozens of other pieces of open source software in the past few years. At the moment, it’s unknown if there was ever a real-world person behind this username or if Jia Tan is a completely fabricated individual.Additional technical analysis is available from the above Bluesky thread from Valsorda, researcher Kevin Beaumont, and Freund’s Friday disclosure.Is There a CVE Tracking Designation?Yes, it's CVE-2024-3094.How Do I Know If the Backdoor Is Present on My Device?There are several ways. One is this page from security firm Binarly. The tool detects implementation of IFUNC and is based on behavioral analysis. It can automatically detect invariants in the event a similar backdoor is implanted elsewhere.There's also a project called xzbot. It provides the following:honeypot: fake vulnerable server to detect exploit attemptsed448 patch: patch liblzma.so to use our own ED448 public keybackdoor format: format of the backdoor payloadbackdoor demo: cli to trigger the RCE assuming knowledge of the ED448 private keyThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.Updated 4/2/2024, 1:23 pm ET to include additional details.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on techSee the thousands of apps hijacked to spy on your locationBig Story: The king of Ozempic is scared as hellThe ‘largest illicit online marketplace’ everUncanny Valley: An insider look at the influence of Silicon ValleyDan Goodin is IT Security Editor at Ars TechnicaXTopicsArs Technicasecurityopen sourcehackingmalwareLinuxRead MoreThe Best VPNs to Protect Yourself OnlineIt won’t solve all of your privacy problems, but a virtual private network can make you a less tempting target for hackers.Scott GilbertsonUSB-C Is Now the Law of the Land in EuropeApple has already pulled devices to comply with the European Commission’s new Common Charger Directive.Kevin Purdy, Ars TechnicaMicrosoft Says It's Time to Replace Your Old Windows 10 PCThe company is using the carrot of \"new features\" and the stick of \"no more updates for your old PC.\"Andrew CunninghamSave 10% On a Website With This Squarespace Promo CodeGet 10% off your next website or domain project at Squarespace when you apply our coupon at checkout.Molly HigginsThe Best Mesh Wi-Fi RoutersForget about patchy internet connections and dead spots in the house.

      "Researchers have found a malicious backdoor in a compression tool that made its way into widely used Linux distributions, including those from Red Hat and Debian.\n",
      "The compression utility, known as xz Utils, introduced the malicious code in versions ​​5.6.0 and 5.6.1, according to Andres Freund, the developer who discovered it. There are no known reports of those versions being incorporated into any production releases for major Linux distributions, but both Red Hat and Debian reported that recently published beta releases used at least one of the backdoored versions—specifically, in Fedora Rawhide and Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions. A stable release of Arch Linux is also affected. That distribution, however, isn't used in production systems.\n",
      "Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, “it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,” Will Dormann, a senior vulnerability analyst at security firm Analygence, said in an online interview. “BUT that's only because it was discovered early due to bad actor sloppiness. Had it not been discovered, it would have been catastrophic to the world.”\n",
      "Several people, including two Ars readers, reported that the multiple apps included in the HomeBrew package manager for macOS rely on the backdoored 5.6.1 version of xz Utils. HomeBrew has now rolled back the utility to version 5.4.6. Maintainers have more details available here.\n",
      "Targeting sshd\n",
      "The first signs of the backdoor were introduced in a February 23 update that added obfuscated code, officials from Red Hat said in an email. An update the following day included a malicious install script that injected itself into functions used by sshd, the binary file that makes SSH work. The malicious code has resided only in the archived releases—known as tarballs—which are released upstream. So-called GIT code available in repositories aren’t affected, although they do contain second-stage artifacts allowing the injection during the build time. In the event the obfuscated code introduced on February 23 is present, the artifacts in the GIT version allow the backdoor to operate.\n",

      "“Given the activity over several weeks, the committer is either directly involved or there was some quite severe compromise of their system,” Freund wrote. “Unfortunately the latter looks like the less likely explanation, given they communicated on various lists about the ‘fixes’” provided in recent updates. Those updates and fixes can be found here, here, here, and here.\n",
      "On Thursday, someone using the developer's name took to a developer site for Ubuntu to ask that the backdoored version 5.6.1 be incorporated into production versions because it fixed bugs that caused a tool known as Valgrind to malfunction.\n",
      "“This could break build scripts and test pipelines that expect specific output from Valgrind in order to pass,” the person warned, from an account that was created the same day.\n",
      "One of maintainers for Fedora said Friday that the same developer approached them in recent weeks to ask that Fedora 40, a beta release, incorporate one of the backdoored utility versions.\n",
      "“We even worked with him to fix the valgrind issue (which it turns out now was caused by the backdoor he had added),” the Ubuntu maintainer said. \"He has been part of the xz project for two years, adding all sorts of binary test files, and with this level of sophistication, we would be suspicious of even older versions of xz until proven otherwise.\"\n",

      "The malicious versions, researchers said, intentionally interfere with authentication performed by SSH, a commonly used protocol for connecting remotely to systems. SSH provides robust encryption to ensure that only authorized parties connect to a remote system. The backdoor is designed to allow a malicious actor to break the authentication and, from there, gain unauthorized access to the entire system. The backdoor works by injecting code during a key phase of the login process.\n",
      "“I have not yet analyzed precisely what is being checked for in the injected code, to allow unauthorized access,” Freund wrote. “Since this is running in a pre-authentication context, it seems likely to allow some form of access or other form of remote code execution.”\n",
      "[Update: Researchers who spent the weekend reverse engineering the updates say that the backdoor injected malicious code during SSH operations, rather than bypassed authenticatiion.]\n",
      "In some cases, the backdoor has been unable to work as intended. The build environment on Fedora 40, for example, contains incompatibilities that prevent the injection from correctly occurring. Fedora 40 has now reverted to the 5.4.x versions of xz Utils.\n",
      "Xz Utils is available for most if not all Linux distributions, but not all of them include it by default. Anyone using Linux should check with their distributor immediately to determine if their system is affected. Freund provided a script for detecting if an SSH system is vulnerable.\n",

An SSH authentication backdoor is surely worse than the Debian weak keys incident and also worse than Heartbleed, the two most notorious Linux security incidents that I can think of. Probably this would have been abused to hack most if not all of the Fortune 500, except Mr. Freund decided to investigate some small performance issue that anybody else would have dismissed as unimportant.

      "On March 29th, it was reported that malicious code enabling unauthorized remote SSH access has been detected within XZ Utils, a widely used package present in major Linux distributions (The GitHub project originally hosted here is now suspended). Fortunately, the malicious code was discovered quickly by the OSS community and managed to infect only two of the most recent versions of the package, 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, which were released within the past month. Stable versions of most Linux distributions were not affected.\n",
      "The sophisticated malicious payload that came with the affected versions of XZ Utils ran in the same process as the OpenSSH server (SSHD) and modified decryption routines in the OpenSSH server in order to allow specific remote attackers (that own a specific private key) to send arbitrary payloads through SSH which will be executed before the authentication step, effectively hijacking the entire victim machine.\n",
      "This supply chain attack came as a shock to the OSS community, as XZ Utils was considered a trusted and scrutinized project. The attacker built up a credible reputation as an OSS developer over the span of multiple years and used highly obfuscated code in order to evade detection by code reviews. Following our initial research communication, this post will detail its fundamentals and impact.\n",

Furthermore, the signature is bound to the host’s public key, meaning that a valid signature for one host cannot be reused on a different host.\n",
      "If the signature was verified as valid, the backdoor uses the bytes directly following the signature bytes as command-specific payload data.

      "The sophisticated nature of this attack and the use of highly future proof crypto algorithms (Ed448 vs the more standard Ed25519) led many to believe that the attack may be a nation-state level cyberattack.\n",

Since the original Ed448 private signing key is not publicly known, this tool is mostly relevant for research purposes (to be used against patched versions of the backdoor, where the Ed448 public key has been replaced by a keypair with a known private key)\n",
      "Timeline of the attack\n",
      "The most notable part of this supply chain attack is the extreme levels of dedication of the attacker, working more than two years to establish themselves as a legitimate maintainer, offering to pick up work in various OSS projects and committing code across multiple projects in order to avoid detection.\n",
      "2021 – GitHub user Jia Tan (JiaT75) account created. Started contributing to several projects with 546 commits done in 2021, of which the most suspicious one was made to libarchive. A more detailed account of this commit can be found below.\n",
      "2022, February 6th – JiaT75 submits a first (legitimate) commit to the XZ repo. The commit adds arguments validation to the LZMA and LZMA2 encoders.\n",

      "2023, March 18th – Jia Tan builds and releases their first release, 5.4.2.\n",
      "2023, June 27-28th – A series of changes were made to XZ Utils, possibly setting the ground for the attack. In these changes, support for ifunc implementation to crc64_fast.c, was added.\n",
      "Introducing the ifunc implementation to XZ Utils\n",
      "Interestingly, this patch was introduced by the original maintainer of the package, Lasse Collin, who credited another contributor for this patch, Hans Jansen. This ifunc implementation is possibly one of the ways which the backdoor seems to operate, according to the analysis by Andres Freund.\n",
      "2023, July 8th – JiaT75 opens a Pull Request in oss-fuzz, a project that performs fuzz testing on XZ and many other OSS projects. The PR disables ifunc fuzzing, which effectively prevents oss-fuzz from finding the malicious changes done in XZ.\n",
      "2024, February 15th – JiaT75 adds an ignore rule for build-to-host.m4 in the XZ repository, via its .gitignore file. This script file, soon to be included in actual release bundles, is executed during the package’s build, and contains the malicious M4 macros which initializes the backdoor’s installation on the victim’s machine.\n",

      "Was only XZ affected by the malicious actor?\n",
      "While the malicious code was detected only on the XZ project, other code contributions of the attacker’s account are currently being investigated. As for today, some notable suspicious code was added to the following projects:\n",
      "libarchive:\n",
      "In 2021, JiaT75 submitted a pull request to the libarchive repository with the title ‘Added error text to warning when untaring with bsdtar’ which seemed legitimate at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the code in this pull request replaced the safe function safe_fprintf() with the unsafe version fprintf(), potentially introducing a character escape vulnerability. The security implications of this change are currently being investigated, as they are not yet clear. However, since a malicious actor is involved in this code modification, it is reasonable to assume that more sophisticated attacks might be at play in this investigation. A PoC for characters escape was already published:\n",
      "PoC by mikesiegel\n",
      "A fix to this vulnerability was introduced to libarchive main branch but has not yet been released as a version update at the time of writing.\n",
      "oss-fuzz:\n",
      "In early 2023, JiaT75 changed the primary email address of the XZ project in Google’s oss-fuzz tool to his own personal Gmail address. This suggests that they may have wanted reports of vulnerabilities found in Project XZ to be reported to them first so that they would know when their malicious actions are discovered –\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in 2023, they opened another PR to disable `Indirect function support` in the fuzzer’s configuration for the XZ project. This looks like preparation for the backdoor they were going to add later to the XZ project to prevent detection by the fuzzer –\n",

      "Invoking: `SaveToTXTTOOL` with `{'text': '### XZ Backdoor Overview\\n\\nThe XZ backdoor refers to a malicious code that was discovered in XZ Utils, a widely used open-source data compression utility, particularly in Linux distributions. This backdoor was introduced in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils and was designed to manipulate the SSH daemon (sshd), allowing unauthorized remote access to systems using SSH.\\n\\n### Discovery of the Backdoor\\n\\nThe backdoor was uncovered by Andres Freund, a developer at Microsoft, while troubleshooting performance issues related to SSH on a Debian system. Freund noticed unusual behavior linked to updates in XZ Utils, leading to the discovery of the malicious code. The backdoor was reported on March 29, 2024, and was identified as a sophisticated supply chain attack that could have had catastrophic consequences if it had not been detected early.\\n\\n### Functionality of the Backdoor\\n\\nThe malicious code modified the way XZ Utils interacts with the SSH daemon. Specifically, it allowed anyone with a predetermined encryption key to inject arbitrary code into SSH login certificates, which could then be executed on the compromised device. This could potentially lead to various malicious actions, including stealing files or installing additional malware.\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n\\n1. **Manipulation of SSH**: The backdoor works by injecting code during the SSH authentication process. It hooks into the RSA public key decryption function, allowing attackers to bypass authentication or execute commands before the authentication step.\\n2. **Obfuscation**: The code was highly obfuscated to evade detection during code reviews, making it difficult for maintainers to identify the malicious changes.\\n3. **Long-term Planning**: The attacker, known by the username JiaT75, had been contributing to open-source projects for years, building a credible reputation before introducing the backdoor.\\n\\n### Timeline of Events\\n- **2021**: JiaT75 created their GitHub account and began contributing to various projects.\\n- **2023**: JiaT75 submitted patches to XZ Utils, eventually introducing the backdoor in early 2024.\\n- **February 2024**: Versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 were released with the backdoor.\\n- **March 29, 2024**: The backdoor was publicly disclosed.\\n\\n### Impact and Response\\n\\nThe backdoor was found in beta releases of major Linux distributions, including Debian and Red Hat, but was not present in stable releases at the time of discovery. The open-source community responded quickly, rolling back affected versions and implementing measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.\\n\\n### Detection and Remediation\\n\\nTo check if a system is affected, users can run commands to verify the version of XZ Utils installed. If vulnerable versions are detected, it is recommended to downgrade to a safe version (5.4.6 or earlier) and restart the SSH service to remove the malicious code from memory.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe XZ backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in open-source software development, particularly regarding supply chain attacks. It underscores the importance of vigilance in code reviews and the need for robust security practices in software development.\\n\\n### Sources\\n- [WIRED: The XZ Backdoor: Everything You Need to Know](https://www.wired.com/story/xz-backdoor-everything-you-need-to-know/)\\n- [Ars Technica: Backdoor found in widely used Linux utility targets encrypted SSH connections](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/)\\n- [JFrog: CVE-2024-3094 XZ Backdoor: All You Need To Know](https://jfrog.com/blog/xz-backdoor-attack-cve-2024-3094-all-you-need-to-know/)'}`\n",
